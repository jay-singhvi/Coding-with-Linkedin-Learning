Embarking on a journey to master Data Science concepts through LinkedIn Learning.


## 1. Introduction to Deep Learning with OpenCV

This repository contains the exercise files and code examples from the LinkedIn Learning course "Introduction to Deep Learning with OpenCV" by Jonathan Fernandes. The course provides a hands-on introduction to deep learning using the OpenCV library for computer vision tasks. I went through these exercises and tweaked them in my own way for me to really grasp the concepts.
