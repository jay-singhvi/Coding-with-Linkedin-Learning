## Introduction to Deep Learning with OpenCV

This repository contains the exercise files and code examples from the LinkedIn Learning course "Introduction to Deep Learning with OpenCV" by Jonathan Fernandes. The course provides a hands-on introduction to deep learning using the OpenCV library for computer vision tasks. I went through these exercises and tweaked them in my own way for me to really grasp the concepts.

## Course Overview

Deep learning is a powerful branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables models to find patterns and insights in data, including images and videos. This course focuses on using OpenCV, a widely adopted computer vision software, to run pre-trained deep learning models on inexpensive hardware and generate insights from digital images and videos.

The course covers the following topics:

- Overview of deep learning concepts and architecture
- Loading and viewing images and videos using OpenCV and Python
- Image and video classification using pre-trained models
- Working with blobs (tensors) in OpenCV
- Object detection using YOLOv3 architecture

## Key Learnings

Through this course, I gained valuable knowledge and practical experience in the following areas:

**Image Classification with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)**
I learned the fundamentals of using pre-trained deep neural network models for image classification tasks with OpenCV. The course covered the process of loading and utilizing these models to classify images accurately, enabling me to understand and apply this powerful technique in various computer vision applications.

**Object Detection with YOLO_v3 Architecture**
The course delved into the YOLO_v3 (You Only Look Once) architecture, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. I acquired the skills to implement this architecture using OpenCV, allowing me to detect and localize multiple objects within images and videos with high accuracy and efficiency.

**Video Analysis and Scene Understanding**
In addition to image processing, the course provided valuable insights into video analysis and scene understanding. I learned how to apply the trained models to video streams, enabling real-time object detection and scene identification. This knowledge is particularly useful for applications such as surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and video analytics.

Overall, the "Introduction to Deep Learning with OpenCV" course equipped me with a solid foundation in deep learning techniques for computer vision tasks. By mastering these concepts and practical skills, I am now better prepared to tackle real-world challenges in image and video processing, object detection, and scene understanding using the powerful OpenCV library.

## Hands-On Experience

While the course provided the theoretical foundation, working through the exercises and modifying the code really solidified my understanding. There's nothing quite like getting your hands dirty with code to truly learn something new.

Overall, this course was an excellent introduction to deep learning with OpenCV, and I'm excited to explore more advanced topics in this field.
